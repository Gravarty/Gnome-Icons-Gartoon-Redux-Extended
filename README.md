A few days ago i found out that Gnome offered a lot of awesome icon packs back in the day, now that everything is flat and boring, i thought to resurrect one of these packs and
Gartoon is the one that interested me the most. It cartoonish and funny but at the same time reminds me a lot of the Windows XP theme. Since i will never find a fitting icon theme
for MATE, this is my personal attempt, to finally have a fun icon theme, that fits my "retro" desktop.

What has been changed?
1. New links for MATE Desktop, so that all icons now correctly use Gartoon icons.
2. Some icons that i have made myself to fit the Gartoon theme, like Spotify, Discord, Chatty etc. Since this is unofficial as hell, i didn't mind using AI for shaping the icons. I still coloured and fixed them myself.

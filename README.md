A few days ago I found out that Gnome had a lot of awesome icon packs back in the day. Now that everything is flat and boring, I thought about resurrecting one of these packs, and Gartoon is the one that interested me the most. It’s cartoonish and funny, but at the same time it reminds me a lot of the Windows XP theme. Since I will never find a fitting icon theme for MATE, this is my personal attempt to finally have a fun icon theme that fits my “retro” desktop.

What has been changed?

1. New links for MATE Desktop so that all icons now correctly use Gartoon icons.

2. Some icons I made myself to fit the Gartoon theme, like Spotify, Discord, Chatty etc. Since this is as unofficial as it gets, I didn’t mind using AI for shaping the icons. I still did the coloring and fixing myself.
